## Structure
The client-side aspect aka Aurelia application is in the ``client`` folder. This is where you author your Aurelia classes, etc. The server-side aspect is in the ``server`` folder which contains Node.js files, etc. 

By default the server ships with Express and is set to serve your Aurelia application from the ``client`` directory.
